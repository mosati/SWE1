###Requirements
Make a program that takes in a set of numbers, computes the average, shows the smallest and largest numbers, and then outputs the numbers in ascending order.

###Plan
Coding done by Justin, Testing done by Tyler, and Documentation done by Karl

Program will be coded in Java and we will use git and GitHub for version control. 

The steps we will take to complete the project are:

1.	Design how the code should work and different features that should be included

2.	Justin will write up the program and inform us of any changes we need to make to our design

3.	Tyler will test the program after Justin is done and if he encounters any problems then Justin will go back and fix them. Keep repeating this process until no more problems are found. 

4.	Karl writes up the documentation to track the planning, progress, and final result of the project

5.	Present the final project to the class with our results and findings

How long expect to complete the project
*	Requirements, Planning, and Design: 35 minutes
*	Coding: 1 hour
*	Testing: 2 hours
* Documentation: 50 minutes


Total time: 4 hours and 25 minutes

###Design
Will use the Eclipse IDE and track revisions with GitHub.

How the program should work:

1. Take in input numbers from a text file and user

2. Sanitize the data to make sure it is a valid input of only numbers

3. Put each number into an ArrayList 

4. Run calculations on the numbers

  * Make separate method to compute the average of the list

  * Sort the list using existing library

  * Find the smallest and largest number of the list using existing library

5. Output the important information to the user using a GUI

###Coding

###Test

###Final Product

The final product launches a GUI window in which the user enters the desired numbers in comma-delimited format (or specifies a text file), the program does the calculations, and then the required output appears in the window.

How long actually took to complete the project
* Requirements, Planning, and Design: 45 minutes
* Coding: 2.5 Hours
* Testing and Revision: 1.5 hours
* Documentation: 40 minutes

Total time: ~5.5 hours
