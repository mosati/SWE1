###Requirements
Make a program that takes in a set of numbers, computes the average, shows the smallest and largest numbers, and then outputs the numbers in ascending order.

###Plan
Coding done by Justin, Testing done by Tyler, and Documentation done by Karl

Program will be coded in Java and we will use version control on GitHub. 

The steps we will take to complete the project are:
1.	Design how the code should work and different features that should be included

2.	Tyler will write up the program and inform us of any changes we need to make to our design

3.	Justin will test the program after Tyler is done and if he encounters any problems then Tyler will go back and fix them. Keep repeating this process until no more problems are found. 

4.	Karl writes up the documentation to track the planning, progress, and final result of the project

5.	Present the final project to the class with our results and findings

How long expect to complete the project
*	Requirements, Planning, and Design: 35 minutes
*	Coding: 1 hour
*	Testing: 2 hours
* Documentation: 50 minutes


Total time: 4 hours and 25 minutes

###Design
Will use the Eclipse IDE and keeping track of version control with GitHub.

How the program should work:

1. Take in input numbers from a text file that 

2. Sanitize the data to make sure it is a valid input of only numbers

3. Put each number into an ArrayList 

4. Run calculations on the numbers

  * Make separate method to compute the average of the list

  * Sort the list using built in classes

  * Find the smallest and largest number of the list using built in classes

5. Output the important information to the user using a GUI

###Coding

###Test

###Final Product

How the final product works is a GUI window appears and the user enters in the desired numbers for the input, the program does the calculations, and then the required output appears in the window.

How long actually took to complete the project
* Requirements, Planning, and Design: 45 minutes
* Coding: 
* Testing: 
* Documentation: 40 minutes
